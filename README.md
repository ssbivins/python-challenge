# python-challenge
A repository for Python homework 2020-08-18 by Susan Bivins

This repository is named "python-challenge"
It contains two folders containing the results of the homework assignment for Week 3, and this README.md file

    - PyBank
    - PyPoll

When running PyBank, the directory folder should be open to the PyBank folder because the file "output.txt" will be placed in the folder PyBank\Analysis, which is found in the PyBank folder (relatively one level up).

When running PyPoll, the directory folder should be open to the PyPoll folder because the file "output.txt" will be placed in the folder PyPoll\Analysis, which is found in the PyPoll folder (relatively one level up).

For both programs, the results will be displayed in the terminal window, as well as in the file "output.txt".

If more time is available, I would use a function in PyPoll to create an array of strings
from the dictionary of candidate data, so they would only be built once and 
could be used for both the print and the text file.
